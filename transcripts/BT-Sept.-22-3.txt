It doesn't speak so bad on Facebook okay it doesn't just please please identity is preface to the no no okay we talked about it and turn them internally yeah 100% I mean you know that's why I kinda too early like our priorities are people like Elvis way down here so that's why we move slower that's why we mitigate our actions thumb and going back I know there it's really big in the media about the no not being thing so these no-knock warrants they provide me with a no-knock warrant you know what we do we knock and announce okay the only time we'll do it no na corn is if he has something if we're like one before doing explosive charge at the bridge point where you can't make announcement joy and review the reserve those for homicide suspects so we even take the extra step hey it's a no-knock warrant we were still going to knock and announce our presence just because the initial danger at the breach Point okay and this warrant was executed according to the investigation detective where there is actually a photograph of the Whiteboard where it is stated knock-and-announce for the Springfield correct okay and then there's something about what she's doing there just might help you will get back to that I'm going to read this I like to think that we going back to your place 16 okay I think the same way other questions we have not asked for you or any other information here that had that may be beneficial to the case this is the man I mean I'm just not so much my interaction with Detective detective hankinson to with my guys we just got to figure that night that you know something really bad happened at the time that Target identification we don't think and again you didn't do the investigation just based upon our initial what we saw and what we were told kind of how we can pay the whole thing because we we want everybody to be safe right that's all I know is we don't want them we don't want us to get her innocent people leaving the bad guys I mean if no one's got to die they don't have some guy like that $14,000 isn't worth it any amount of dogs not worth it easier as we debrief and kind of looked over he was just it was just an egregious. Me from what I've respected if that's in fact what happened have other details Tundra like it is what it is it seems like there was no talking identification watch wherever of those around that were shot outside the apartment it really see muscle fire maybe we can get there start with a k 813 560 app I do not see anything in the apartment I want to say it was those white vertical blinds but I could be wrong it was something there was definitely a white barrier in that and you could see in any of the windows there that I could but I could see I mean cuz we couldn't even see any light or Darkness it was just like I said just to wipe I believe they were vertical blinds okay question 1 is it and this is the first time I shoot this is a question I'm not sure you can answer or either you're the appropriate person to ask this but you know since you have a lot of weapons training tennis tournament if someone is to fire a weapon in a illuminated area into a darkened area with that muzzle flash projected to that dark area if it's covered by cloth windows and stuff no you wouldn't see anything this is directory I think it was but it was basically. David way everybody does it but I guess you do you mind if someone is involved in this they should be separated from one SWAT goes and everybody checking everything and they should be removed and not your best practices anybody involved in the shooting like that should be separated Pizza Hut Costco's are there in the to the Madison Pointe tell someone he can't remember that he needs to be separated Cosgrove need to be separated from he made a comment about Circulon what you need to do them and figured well will swatow restaurant and he wasn't apparently he scored his said that he wasn't aware of Springfield that's hiring with his had but he would suggest just wait till we get there to assist but remember play music but if you remember what he says he does remember during the briefing bring feeling coming up to 73 please actually they have a procedure or how to enter for no. And it was his statement that he's not like they should have waited or swallow to employer but they were going to the detectives we're not going to say. Agreed that it was not going to be served as a no nothing but Steve will a SWAT procedure USF OK Google server alone wouldn't have mentioned the Matrix and I'm assuming it is a risk Matrix Worthy's you do a risk assessment couple days before the entry number for safety standards what they look for you or anybody got any possible weapons in and then they decide they risk assessment number or something for that figure out what they need an ocelot or whether they it's a lower level of threat and he did confirm that he did not see or know about my phone plan for will maker or a matrix protector news I guess there was an email that he said 30 days prior but then later on it says maybe 2 or 3 weeks for her understanding is yes everybody freeze should have been in there and should have heard if if can I see a pic of Carrie but he said that he was he says he doesn't recall Spring Company in Springfield is connected to alien correct Elliott won the Newbery they were in the front area parent Lane and they wouldn't call him now that's what it is so they did you say you wanted to make you take one of those out of the building John Elliott was abandoned building I think he might have so his assessment for Springfield is he didn't even have any of his people at Springfield take a break now
