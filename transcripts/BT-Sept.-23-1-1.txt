You don't know the answer that okay there they're asking whether they had approved or unapproved Firearms Oneida shoes and he did say from the forensic all the shell casings were from the $40 they're all on the 40 caliber gun yes but there were three separate files that were hit that were fired. Thank you escargot Madden 77 15 of the Casey's in detective Mattingly Wicked where is the casing 27 28 13 and 31 and this is out in the Breezeway and we're approximately if you can tell by looking at this photo was Brianna's apartment that night leave here is the door with pride over Kid Rock.

Where you at Walmart yes I did and who fired that bullet that night to take it back to 82 who sells sliding glass doors at appear. Got all shot up do that night 83 was that forensics examined by the Kentucky State Police ballistic expert yes it was why they able from that forensic exam of that bullet to determine who fired that bullet that went through the apartment 3 and landed on the floor who did that detect an accent when checking her like one I just got one quick I need to check with real real quick I don't have any. that way we talked to her lately I want your hair back bullet holes that were located inside apartment 3 there were none of the bullets recovered in turn around this scene in shooting at night that correct yes sir and a number I want all of them to see if they could determine who the origin of those that correct and so when you're going to be telling the jury who fired it it's it's not it's based on the reported forensic exam by Ballistic expert that right and so let's go to number 85 and guess I think Jerry seen this before bit just for the record if y'all Orion what do we wear out where are we in that and Brianna's apartment there are some markers there is that right just 42 is one of them right there is that correct and was that bullying forensic exam who's bullet was that who fired Cosgrove there's a marker 43. Right next to Brianna's body lying down there is if you recall what that is that that is a phone that's all that's her cell phone and then 41 can you see that just shine that what is that I am worthy the listing of the origin of that Casey what gunfire did that let that casing here on the floor clock 43x casing came from that fire just government walk the gunman's walk her head and had and did Prince exam work on just like we've been talking to them hi 86 where are we just work where and we're still embryonic the park here are not okay and where their bullets that were recovered by the police department examining this this apartment that night and we actually have their sale holes bullet holes in this where they're bullets recover from that and and if we get to Oriental during her apologize Jordan shiny two entries are okay thank you let's go to 40 45 and if we could meet the next at his 4540s 47 gun it's a women is not as bad as the marker number 87 can we go to 87 I'm sorry and what is that we're looking at Mark 45 iron what is that alright where did they attempt to match that they have any success when can we go back for just about to see that Rod there and what that is can we go back to 86 for a moment thank you and that pan did it come from this particular left in the bottom there thank you can we go to 88 from thank all right did they recover a bullet in that area that the stove in his kitchen yes and whereabouts is that can you show the jury are you go and 46 was that examined by the ballistics experts at the Kentucky State Police lab yes were they able to make any determination of the wave gun fired at bullet that landed there next to the stove yes questions Play the album caliper asking if we know the caliber the question make a kilometer quite that items that were dammit Lakewood Ohio I know it's in there they were all identified is 40 caliber and when I say you can clusiv actually what they're saying is Foxborough I apologize I didn't bring that point up when we say that didn't match it didn't necessarily mean they're selling outlier that shot that he had they know it was one of the three either by Prospero John had in there but there was insufficient detail on the bullet for them to conclude which and let me go back cuz you're looking at what striations is far and there has to be a sufficient number of identical marks where they say yes and he can they call it an even clusive so I may be using some music terms and they were able to match that up what they said they weren't but they know a good morning. I want different was one you saw hallway. Gadwall I thought we had a question before you ask but if you have any way you can please continue that you all are here. now when we were going when you were showing at Jerry the outside this window you work all that belong to Brianna's sister's bedroom yessir we've looked at me and pointed out a bullet holes in it and the screen adjacent to that window before I got blown out that right yes sir we recover and I'm looking at exhibit 89 not that's what I'm about to do now yes 89 guess what are bullets located and the sister's bedroom is that marker 47 is that where one of the bullets was located was it in her dresser drawer yes you going to go to the number 90 photograph number 90s yeah okay yeah thank you went out wait, go back real quick 247 was that a projector or bullet I'm calling it because it's located and where they both did they examine it and if they were they able to distinguish whether it was Costco Mattingly or or I can send that fire Dept. I'm sorry I stepped on was there a second bullet found in and the sisters bedroom was it in the closet over bedroom is 48 a marker that was used to identify the location of that bullet on that one the police found it and was that bullet take it down to the KSP lab and examined and see if they could determine who the source who shot that bullet into her bedroom crossword it was indistinguishable they could not tell which out to apologize 91 shoebox yes is there a hole in that bullet what appears to be a bullet hole just did they locate a projectile in there then and I got two boxes with what is that appear from looking at the photo where that is located I want your job at the visual but don't buy freon MJ date were they able to match that bullet with any of the three Farms use about three the three detectives know so they could have came from any of their weapons but they were not able to distinguish what you want yes it was located in the closet but I believe they took it out when they photographed if you put it on and see here's a closet good question though I appreciate it it was Rachel and the closet is that clear thank you let's go get 90 2 could we do that for a moment and then we might want flip back and forth explain to Jerry what we're looking at there in the closet where the shoe box is located that a board hold a mark is that where that shoe box was before it was moved and examined by the police yes ma'am just stopped and we go back and look at that closet that removes specialize in there though so she can to see what it shows . that answer your question yes ma'am not helpful McConnell my ringer is getting at my Jeffrey tell me a little bit about what is this who did this work for yes when we got question yes, The Shoe Box what is the weather like look at the wall on the other side what is a trajectory is that answer your question man here's the where can I listen to Jeffrey except I think we may have seen some of the other day with with Barbara what is it that all these lines and Marksman what is this exhibit we're looking at now and how is it how does it help us this was prepared by the FBI when they went in as a reporter and basically it just shows how do they take the holes in the bulletin where they're able to match up things and get up idea where they came from and then go back and show with Direction these rounds came from you can see these rounds here that we talked about earlier, in the direction of where detective hankinson's casings were found as well as he's the code through I'm in these rounds here come in the direction of where detective Cosgrove working at and not every fire shot can we get a trajectory on is that correct sometimes depending on what the hell what it was they can establish it's not a cleaning up power clean enough to do a trajectory said I can't do everyone but these were the ones into me this kind of makes me shake my head and get an understanding what was going on for instance if you if you don't have a hole or an exit from which a bullet can be located can they do a trajectory it depends on if they know they can't if it if they can if they find a bullet that was laying in the floor with having a couple times in this take it they can but like the good indications here where you have a screen door that had five shots in it before she dies and then you have a wall over here it's easy to then come up with trajectories the more points you have that you what's on the other side of this Walmart are DMS apartment 3 the pictures we showed you earlier but other than others and help you all seeing some pictures actually make love to you earlier and I show you where was firing shots outside of the apartment and your family if you could show the one up and that's when we're getting ready to show at 2 that appears to goes through the other sister's bedroom at Texas right to 92 which is a bullet with the police found at. Just and what what what where is this the bullet located at Wichita see if the bathroom back and it went through if you looked at injector report and it came to rest hi. I was just getting ready to ask her to do that show them what bathroom mat is where that bullet thing and this and they didn't I need theirs too bad Friends the one on the right is that the one that off of a day on what you call and tell me what they call the master esquin wine call it the sister s bedroom at call high now we got a room the sisters bathroom had was that taken to the truck State Police glad to determine if they could identify who fired that bullet that night that landed in the in that bathroom are you sure I was determined to come from a detective hankinson's what I thank you was there a furnace in the hallway in the hallway of Brianna's apartment and was there a bullet recovered from that furnace by the police just alright that's 93 thanks and was as I've asked you before was that bullet markers and photo is exhibit 93 is that also examined by the forensic expert at the Kentucky State Police left was he able to identify who fired that bullet that went into the furnace just tomorrow now you would mention mention that the FBI did some their own for renting exam at inside the apartment they came back and conducted another search warrant and collected some additional projectile tonight or did they dig into the walls and pull out some bullet that at the head not here for men so I'm going to go through a few of these and two of them are fairly important. At 8 yesterday dead these are bullets that were found make a song Java head Stout monopolizing all right we're going to go through some yet here you have your FBI results yes or no now these are balls that were recovered by the FBI and the bullets that they recover did they examine those bullets forensic yes sir I where we review in the FBI report where you to dective able to specifically determine in a wall with void of always exactly in the wall where I bought they've been recovered or just the general room search up and want and want and since we do have the bullet holes we're going to talk to Jerry about that the minute I print we have eight and dining room lights room a and I was a board covered in the wall that dining room and was that examined forensically to see if they could have termin the origin what who shot the FBI was able to determine that they came from to take the tank and since and then they also recover one from the Brianna's room at the h yes I am the wall right in there and were they able to turn in that instance the source of that bullet that wasn't him better than her wall who was that a detective Hankins and another one was there not a second one also in better than that the wall of her bedroom and what did the forensics say to the origin of that whole detective hankinson's weapon it was also a bullet recovered from the living room from the wall in the living room that in that general area all right and who was the source of that boy that went into the that was embedded in the Wall To Live detective Madden time we also they found one that was in the hallway is that right I have 94 can I put that up at 94. There is 1994 is that contain the a bullet that's in the hallway yes there's three of them and the date did the FBI able to recover two of those three from the hole and were they able to determine who the source was and was there any other material on that bullet that was Renly thing they were able to recover DNA off of that projectile that they can say was a female DNA or some other biological substance on the bullet yes or no and you are why we're here on that was there a second fully recover from them by the FBI from them that wall that we're looking at a projectile was recovered from there. But also had female DNA and who was the source of that gun detector Cosgrove yes it's right here right here behind where the victim was lying what happened in France yesterday no it was the bullet was recovered I'm sorry I should be test that she's asking to get when he goes to work I apologize stepping on your answer your question red I've been the DNA on both of those projectiles was insane female DNA they could say it was the same female Chicago News yes sir. Thank God one was from detective Cosgrove's weapon in one was from detected Mattingly's weather I get the question. I also have it on hallway. There's a did they recover another bullet down there not one of the two we just talked about and who is were they able to determine the source of that there was a detective Cosgrove and another one in the hallway they bet dug out of the wall is that correct I got everything but the living room okay and was there another one from the living room wall that there wasn't a bullet was embedded in there and that was detective Cosgrove's okay I think I get to the two bones that will recover from the body can we have to talk about what they did I want to go back some if I could okay just when we first started this morning jurors you talked about the autopsy just so you remember that and you talk about yes sir and there were three of them is that right yes sir was one of them embedded in the heel of the foot of her but yes sir yes sir no it was not a specifically now there were two of them over there and one of those that was the one in the upper right yes you are long she said in part of her arteries that right yes or no and they were examined by the Kentucky State Police and worth when Kentucky plays a good example if they could lose a source of those two bullets in her torso yes sir and do they do they do that through an examination of striations made from the bullets they recover from her body along with test sample bullets that they took at the lab yes probably for the three firearms used by the policeman and in doing so are they attempting to match up for lack of better term striations and other unique marks on the bullet that was recovered from Brianna do the same kinds of markings that may be present on the test bullets from the three policemen around 400 years and they do they do that with intensity magnifying quipment yes sir that expands you know considerably the ability for them to examine these small and unique marks on both discs for me. Manufacturing paraphernalia inside the barrel yes and they and overtime other Mark to come from the use of all of which are considered by the forensic and I could be unique incapable if you can with with used with a qualified expert to match bullets with guns and Steven fuse the forensic expert at our lab urine in Frankfurt did he examine no two bullets and attempt to see which of these three policemen may have Fargo's to Floyd's in the garage that caused her death and what was his determination you cannot distinguish between the three officers weapons which one had five those projectiles because they are important forensic exams believe this work isn't is there a fair amount of subject. You can yes it's not like DNA know it's important but it doesn't have the same scientific that DNA does now later on you can we can talk about the FBI they came out and work on the same as well yes operated and other aspects of the investigation with you guys yesterday and did they decide to take a look at these two bullets yesterday do y'all together but I can concentrate on the two yesterday went down the wrong and the one right in here to happening that you talk to the jury and they have the same kinds of tools I talked about kind of soup generally they're so I believe they're the exact same type of microscope and equally qualified Steven Hughes different results until the jury was what was there finding the FBI Examiner Route 35 doing so he blocked and at found and his opinion Boardwalk Apartments for rent or buy to the test port to use for comparison purposes from the three policemen and examining goes it was his judgment that they will fire by Costco to do going to the Torso of Israel taken call the song life we have we don't have no sir I have a conflict we have Kentucky State Police forensic examiner well-qualified right yes you work with him all of us at one time or another okay but he said he found it was inconclusive amount of similarity for him to make a call there's a match that screw and that's his projector judgment where some subjectivity enters into it summer examiners if not more aggressive than others in their attempts to come over to God and using the same or similar of equipment they need the FBI person they're examiner found that there was sufficient detail his opinion essay miles Costco fire the two boys one of which killed freon I'm going to check with my colleagues here make sure I have left anything out have an idea oh okay and 6 and therefore you're all the damnation and any questions you might have other still have it and I let me check with my okay that's all I have up that we're we're here for any questions you might have a detective Wolfe there is a feeling of apartment for the apartment above toilet my question is on Sprague for the graduates in the show PS flight so many more lots of people being sprayed with Rome at doorway in other words saying I don't know where magazine what's a pinata I think that's what this is why they barked the trajectory points if they can identify I don't think there's any significance to the martyrs they just put those around attractive Martha different trajectories and there was one I think you see this area here is the beginning of pretty much all of the trajectory switches pretty much right now 1 Boro Hotel October 20th but from the floor up that's the bottom of the proper position for today where is that covered located between the did CNN that the show history would have been in one of those. But look at the pictures looks to me like it's a go to the events of chapter 7 in the NBA so that means yeah right there is a no look at me if you look at these this this one you got. yeah El Paso this picture trajectory of course is only only ones that they can track her so like the one that says what you want to do or just grab something I do not have been able to determine where that is coming from did you look at that that's only speculation on my part when you look at the close up on a music for you use it once they like to use a pipe Exodus Hospital stop playback. Which question 1234 protect Hospital North Carolina address please but they're only two against the wall went all the way down now, come down both ride a narwhal remember Walkers KC score for the richer than the other Celestia UnityPoint some of those with a marking things like in his hall or where they believe them the bullet hits something and then continued on Rozonda Thomas cancel Malaysia Flight 37 connect me to comparison download was it a straight shot of a sudden download yes ma'am there was one that a bullet in case of Kosmos weapons yes ma'am no that's it for checked out for Casey the Casey's were all out no man Walker's baby Walker's basic units in drive-thru yes the Walnut one of those Mattingly and the tomb of those three were from Costco no no man wants for me how far can I answer for you on your recording caliber Mag Caliber Martin 2022 Glock 40 caliber Wilson it's just a little bit bigger.
